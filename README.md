# Data Documentation

# What we did

## Cleaning

This data was cleaned using Google Sheets and OpenRefine. Particular attention was paid to location, dates, and publishers.
For more information about how the data was cleaned, see cleaning_decisions.md

## Reconciling

We used Wikidata's reconciling service to match our publisher data to pages on wikidata. This allows us to track which comics were published by the same publisher regardless of name changes.
